# Ship Autonomous AI Agents
## Without Creating a Compliance Nightmare

Deploy AI agents with **hard guardrails**, **human approvals**, and **evidence-grade audit logs** that satisfy regulators and courts.

## The Problem

Your team built an AI agent that could:

- Onboard customers (KYC/AML checks)
- Triage insurance claims
- Execute trades or approve transactions
- Send customer communications
- Update CRMs and case systems

**But compliance won't sign off.**

Why? Because they're asking questions you can't answer:

### "Who authorized this?"
Attribution and accountability

### "Can we stop it at runtime?"
Kill switches and intervention

### "Can we prove what happened?"
Evidence-grade audit trails

### "How do we audit this later?"
Compliance and regulatory reporting

---

## The Solution: UAPK Gateway

**A non-bypassable control plane for AI agent actions.**

Think of it as:

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Firewall** | Policy enforcement at the action boundary |
| **Black Box Recorder** | Tamper-evident audit logs for every decision |
| **Kill Switch** | Human approvals for high-risk actions |
| **Budget Control** | Rate limits and spend caps per agent |

**Deploys on one VM. Self-hosted. No vendor lock-in.**

## How It Works (30 Seconds)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as AI Agent
    participant Gateway as UAPK Gateway
    participant Human as Human Approver
    participant Tool as Tool/API

    Agent->>Gateway: "Send this contract"
    Gateway->>Gateway: ✓ Check authorization<br/>✓ Check budget<br/>✓ Check policy rules

    alt ALLOW
        Gateway->>Tool: Execute
        Tool-->>Gateway: Success
        Gateway->>Gateway: Log (tamper-evident)
        Gateway-->>Agent: Success
    else DENY
        Gateway->>Gateway: Log violation
        Gateway-->>Agent: Policy violation
    else ESCALATE
        Gateway->>Human: Approval request
        Human-->>Gateway: Approve/Deny
        Gateway->>Tool: Execute if approved
        Gateway->>Gateway: Log decision
        Gateway-->>Agent: Result
    end
```

**Key principle:** Agents **propose** actions. Gateway **enforces** policy. Tools run with **gateway credentials**, not agent credentials.

## What You Get

### Policy Enforcement
Define what agents can/can't do (UAPK Manifest). Hard limits on budgets, rates, and scopes. Risk hooks for external review.

### Human Approvals
Escalate high-risk actions to operators. Web UI + API for approval workflows. Audit trail of every decision.

### Tamper-Evident Logs
Every action produces an immutable interaction record. Hash-chained log with gateway signatures. Export bundles for auditors.

### Capability Tokens
Scoped delegation (time-limited, action-limited). Prevents "agent drift". Cryptographically signed and verifiable.

### Production-Ready
FastAPI + PostgreSQL (proven stack). Docker Compose deployment (one VM). Health checks, metrics, backups. Self-hosted.

### Fast Deployment
Production-ready in 2-4 weeks with our pilot program. Fixed-fee pricing. No hourly billing.

## Who This Is For

### You should care if:

- You're shipping agents in **finance, legal, or compliance** environments
- You need a **governance story** to close enterprise deals
- Compliance keeps blocking your agent deployments
- You need **evidence-grade audit trails** for regulators or courts

### You probably don't need this if:

- Your agents only do research/summarization (no actions)
- You're in early prototyping (not production yet)
- You're fine with vendor-hosted logs and no auditability

---

## Pricing & Engagement

**Free (Apache-2.0)**

Self-host UAPK Gateway on your infrastructure

[Get Started →](/docs/quickstart/)

### Agent Governance Pilot
**$15,000 - $25,000** (2-4 weeks)

We implement UAPK Gateway for one high-value workflow

**Deliverables:**
- Production-ready manifest + guardrails
- Self-hosted gateway on your infrastructure
- Approvals flow + evidence-grade logs
- Compliance export bundle
- Operator training

[Learn More →](/docs/business/pilot/)

### Enterprise Support
**$3K - $10K/month**

Ongoing support for production deployments

## Why Now?

**Agentic AI is moving from demos to production.**

- OpenAI Swarm, Anthropic MCP, LangChain agents are shipping to customers
- Enterprise buyers want agents but need **governance, audit, and control**
- Compliance teams are the new gatekeepers
- UAPK Gateway gives you the "yes, but safely" answer

**Model vendors will improve tool-calling.** But they won't solve:

- Non-bypassable enforcement at your boundary
- Organization-owned evidence (not vendor retention logs)
- Cross-model, cross-vendor governance standards

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Q: What if agents just bypass the gateway?**

**Answer:** In production, tools run with credentials **controlled by the gateway**. Agents don't have direct access. This is enforced at the infrastructure level.

**Q: What if the gateway becomes a bottleneck?**

**Answer:** Designed for < 100ms p99 latency. Horizontal scaling supported (multi-instance + shared Postgres). Most actions are async (approval flows don't block the agent).

**Q: What if we need custom connectors?**

**Answer:** Open connector framework. We provide HTTP, webhook, and mock out of the box. Custom connectors are part of the pilot or support engagement.

**Q: What if compliance requirements change?**

**Answer:** Policies are versioned and stored in manifests. Update the manifest, re-activate, and the new rules apply immediately. Full history is logged.
